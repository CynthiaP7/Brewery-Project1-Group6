# Welcome fellow Crewmates!

    Welcome to the official website of Brews and Crews, where loved ones (and their barely tolerated add-ons) 
    can mingle together over the simple joys of fine beer. Did you know that almost every single ethnic group 
    has made their own varieties of beer throughout the ages?

    Now you too can share in our ancestral heritage of gathering around and sharing news at the meal table.

# Our Company

    Brews and Crews was the culmination of desire and practicality. With our wonderful GoogleMapsTM powered GPS, you can find up to 
    50 breweries across the 48 continuous states of good -ol America, letting you appreciate all that America has to offer. 
    With convienence.


# The Trio of Devs

    Meet our development Team:

    Cynthia Pian, our team leader and overall manager of the this project.

    Emmanuel Barroso, Developer(Dev) (CSS, Javascript, index.html)

    Tae Chung, Developer(Dev), (index.html, CSS, Javascript)

# Installation



# Development: 1

    First Cynthia Pian laid the groundwork by setting up the repository for our website, https://github.com/CynthiaP7/Brewery-Project1-Group6. 
    Then, Developer Tae set up the basic code for the index.html, while Develoepr Emmanuel did the same for CSS and Javascript.
    And then the Trio found the geolocation and brewery APIs.

# Development: 2

    One of most arduous hurdles we encountered was the position of the map. At first, it was off center.
    Eventually, Developer Emmanuel fixed this after altering the index.html and script.js files.

# Development: 3

    Another significant hurdle we encountered was the navigation links being a dark grey
    (thus hard to see), the navbar was manipulated to turn the text white.
    The other texts were turned white by adding color:white; to the style.css 'body' file.
